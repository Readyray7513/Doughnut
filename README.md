# Blender Doughnut Project

## 🍩 Overview
This repository contains my **photo-realistic Blender doughnut**, created by following Blender Guru's famous **Doughnut Tutorial**. It's a milestone in my 3D modeling journey and my first serious dive into Blender's rendering, texturing, and lighting!

## 🎨 Features
- **High-resolution textures** for realistic frosting and sprinkles.
- **Procedural shading** to give the doughnut depth and detail.
- **Realistic lighting setup** using Blender's **Cycles** renderer.
- **Subsurface scattering** for the fluffy dough feel.
- **Sprinkles with physics** for natural randomness.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Blender 4.x**
- **Cycles Renderer**
- **HDRI Lighting**
- **Node-based Material Editor**

## 📂 Files
- `doughnut.blend` → The main Blender project file.
- `textures/` → High-quality texture files (if applicable).
- `renders/` → Final rendered images (if included).

## 🚀 How to View
1. Open **Blender 4.x or newer**.
2. Load `doughnut.blend`.
3. Switch to **Rendered View** (Cycles recommended).
4. Enjoy the deliciousness! 🍩

## 🔮 Future Plans
- Add a **coffee cup** ☕ to complement the doughnut.
- Animate a **bite being taken** out of it.
- Experiment with **different icing colors & flavors**.
